Performing machine translation using tools in natural language processing

# Project: Machine Translation
Machine translation is a widely researched field, with new papers being published each year. Over the years, various methods have been developed, including rule-based, statistical, and example-based machine translation approaches. Despite all the research and effort, it remains an unsolved problem. However, recent advancements in neural networks have significantly advanced the field of machine translation.

In this project, I built a deep neural network that serves as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. This pipeline takes English text as input and returns the corresponding French translation.
