# NLP Machine Translation

**Building an End-to-End Neural Machine Translation Pipeline**

This project demonstrates the implementation of a neural machine translation (NMT) system that translates English text into French. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation, utilizing TensorFlow and Keras.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Develop a neural machine translation system to translate English sentences into French.
- **Dataset**: Utilizes the English-French sentence pairs dataset.
- **Framework**: Built using TensorFlow 1.x and Keras 2.x.
- **Model**: Implements a sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism.

## Repository Structure

- **machine_translation.ipynb** — Jupyter notebook containing the complete workflow for building and training the NMT model.
- **helper.py** — Utility functions for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- **project_tests.py** — Unit tests for evaluating the model's performance.
- **README.md** — This file.

## Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:
   
   `git clone https://github.com/hamidghasemi69/NLP-Machine-Translation.git`

   `cd NLP-Machine-Translation`
  
2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   
   `jupyter notebook machine_translation.ipynb`

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, define the model, train it, and evaluate its performance.
