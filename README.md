Performing machine translation using tools in natural language processing

# Project: Machine Translation
Machine translation is a popular topic in research with new papers coming out every year. Over the years of research, different methods were created, like rule-based, statistical, and example-based machine translation. With all this effort, itâ€™s still an unsolved problem. However, neural networks have made a large leap forward in machine translation.

In this project, I built a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. This pipeline accepts English text as input and returns the French translation.
